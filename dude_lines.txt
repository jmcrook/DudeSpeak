				It's the LeBaron.
				It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
				Lemme take another look.
				Oh, man.  Don't do--
				Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You
				got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,
				man.
				Bunny?  Look, moron.
				You see a wedding ring?  Does this
				place look like I'm fucking married?
				All my plants are dead!
				Obviously you're not a golfer.
				Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.
				Yeah man, it really tied the room
				together--
				What's your point, Walter?
				What's the point of--we all know who
				was at fault, so what the fuck are
				you talking about?
				My rug.
				This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
				can't go give him a bill so what the
				fuck are you talking about?
				Walter, this is not a guy who built
				the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
				who peed on my--
				Walter, he peed on my rug--
				So who--
				No, but--
				Yeah, but--
				Fuckin' A.
				Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
				Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should
				compensate me for the fucking rug.
				I mean his wife goes out and owes
				money and they pee on my rug.
				Yes, uh, very impressive.
				I'm not really, uh.
				Uh-huh.
				Uh-huh.
				Hey, is this him with Nancy?
				Lebowski on the right?
				He's handicapped, huh?
				Far out.
				Nancy's pretty good.
				Are these.
				Different mothers, huh?
				I guess he's pretty, uh, racially
				pretty cool--
				I see.
				Jeez.  Think he's got room for one
				more?
				Well, yeah I did, but I spent most
				of my time occupying various, um,
				administration buildings--
				--smoking thai-stick, breaking into
				the ROTC--
				--and bowling.  I'll tell you the
				truth, Brandt, I don't remember most
				of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
				Well sir, it's this rug I have, really
				tied the room together-
				Well they were looking for you, these
				two guys, they were trying to--
				So you know they were trying to piss
				on your rug--
				You mean, did you personally come
				and pee on my--
				Well no, like I said, Woo peed on
				the rug--
				Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam
				anybody here, I'm just--
				Look, let me explain something.
				I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr.
				Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's
				what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.
				His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,
				you know, you're not into the whole
				brevity thing--
				Employed?
				Is this a--what day is this?
				No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.
				This will not stand, ya know, this
				will not stand, man.  I mean, if
				your wife owes--
				Ah fuck it.
				Okay.  The old man told me to take
				any rug in the house.
				It's the LeBaron.
				Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the
				neighborhood, need to use the john.
				Huh?
				You want me to blow on your toes?
				You sure he won't mind?
				Practicing?
				You're Bunny?
				I'm just gonna find a cash machine.
				Your maples, Carl.
				You're fucking twenty minutes late.
				What the fuck is that?
				Huh?
				What the fuck're you talking about?
				The carrier.  What's in the fucking
				carrier?
				What the fuck are you--
				You brought a fucking Pomeranian
				bowling?
				Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
				me to take care of her fucking dog
				while she and her boyfriend went to
				Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
				herself.  Why can't she board it?
				Hey man--
				Come on Walter, it's just--it's
				Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a
				little, it's just a game.
				Hey Walter--
				Walter, they're calling the cops,
				put the piece away.
				Walter, you can't do that.  These
				guys're like me, they're pacificists.
				Smokey was a conscientious objector.
				And you know Smokey has emotional
				problems!
				He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
				No, you're not wrong--
				You're not wrong, Walter, you're
				just an asshole.
				Just, just take it easy, Walter.
				Well, just take 't easy, man.
				Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
				Just take it easy, man!
				Shit!
				Hiya Allan.
				Sure Allan, I'll be there.
				Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
				Yeah, okay.
				Huh.
				Dude.
				I don't know, sir.
				Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
				Mind if I smoke a jay?
				'Scuse me?
				Fuckin' A.
				Bummer.
				Why me, man?
				So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,
				huh?
				Fucking Quintana--that creep can
				roll, man--
				Huh?
				Huh.
				Twenty grand.  And of course I still
				keep the rug.
				Yeah.
				...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so
				whenever these guys call--
				I told him if it was during league
				play--
				I figure it's easy money, it's all
				pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
				kidnapped herself.
				Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
				look at it.  Young trophy wife.
				Marries a guy for money but figures
				he isn't giving her enough.  She
				owes money all over town--
				It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
				said, look for the person who will
				benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
				you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
				to say--
				Yeah.
				Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
				I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
				Walter.
				Walter, face it, there isn't any
				connection.  It's your roll.
				It's your roll--
				It's your roll.
				Yeah well, that's just, ya know,
				like, your opinion, man.
				Jesus.
				Oh man.
				Oh, nothin', you know.
				Uh-huh.
				Oh, man, don't say that..
				Shit.
				The what?
				What the hell is this?
				Agh--
				Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
				you brought your dirty undies--
				Walter--what the fuck are you
				thinking?
				We?  What the fuck we?  You said you
				just wanted to come along--
				Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a
				fucking game, Walter--
				Yeah, but--
				Dude here.
				Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want
				us to go?
				Yeah?
				The driver man, I told you--
				Oh shit.  Walter.
				They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it
				up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was
				in our hands!
				We're screwed now!  We don't get
				shit and they're gonna kill her!
				We're fucked, Walter!
				Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say
				peep when I'm doing business here.
				Dude here.
				Yeah.
				Hey, just tell me where the fuck you
				want us to go.
				That was the sign.
				Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't
				told me how we get her back.  Where
				is she?
				Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.
				That's fucking ingenious, if I
				understand it correctly.  That's a
				Swiss fucking watch.
				Dude.
				FUCK.
				There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!
				At a wooden bridge we throw the money
				out  of the car!
				We throw the money out of the moving
				car!
				Well call them up and explain it to
				'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking
				simple, I'm sure they'd fucking
				understand it!  That's the beauty of
				it Walter!
				I'm throwing the money, Walter!
				We're not fucking around!
				Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but
				sooner or later you're gonna have to
				face the fact that you're a goddamn
				moron.
				Walter!
				What the fuck?
				Uzi?
				Walter, please--
				WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!
				WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!
				What the fuck is that supposed to
				mean?  What the fuck're we gonna
				tell Lebowski?
				Huh?  The problem is--what do you
				mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
				they're gonna kill that poor woman--
				No, Walter!  I said I thought she
				kidnapped herself!  You're the one
				who's so fucking certain--
				Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
				Walter--
				Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about
				that poor woman?  What do we tell--
				Yeah, and in the meantime what do I
				tell Lebowski?
				Walter, how--
				That's it.  I'm out of here.
				But Walter, we didn't make the fucking
				hand- off!  They didn't get, the
				fucking money and they're gonna--
				they're gonna--
				Walter--
				"Our" car, Walter?
				You don't know, Walter?  You seem to
				know the answer to everything else!
				It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking
				know it's been stolen!
				Aw, fuck it.
				I'm going home, Donny.
				Thank you, Donny.
				1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
				Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,
				coloration.
				Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple
				of Creedence tapes.  And there was
				a, uh. . . my briefcase.
				Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my
				papers.  Business papers.
				I'm unemployed.
				...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But
				it's nice when they offer.
				...Also, my rug was stolen.
				No.  Here.
				You find them much?  Stolen cars?
				And the, uh, the briefcase?
				Is that what that's a picture of?
				Oh yeah?
				"Johnson"?
				Huh?
				Right, but let me explain something
				about that rug--
				Excuse me?
				I was talking about my rug.
				You mean coitus?
				Oh, no.
				Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your
				stepmother is a nympho, but I don't
				see what it has to do with--do you
				have any kalhua?
				Shit, I know that guy.  He's a
				nihilist.
				He fixes the cable?
				Shit yeah, the achievers.
				Yeah, but my-
				Well--sure, I could do that--
				A hundred.
				Yeah, but what about--
				Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
				That's really thoughtful but I--
				Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.
				Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya
				Tony.
				Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be
				worrying about that shit.  Life goes
				on!
				Huh?
				When did he-
				Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!
				Well we--I don't--
				No, man, nothing is fucked here--
				C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?
				Those guys are--we dropped off the
				damn money--
				I--the royal we, you know, the
				editorial--I dropped off the money,
				exactly as per--Look, I've got certain
				information, certain things have
				come to light, and uh, has it ever
				occurred to you, man, that given the
				nature of all this new shit, that,
				uh, instead of running around blaming
				me, that this whole thing might just
				be, not, you know, not just such a
				simple, but uh--you know?
				I'll tell you what I'm blathering
				about!  I got information--new shit
				has come to light and--shit, man!
				She kidnapped herself!
				Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy
				wife, I mean, in the parlance of our
				times, owes money all over town,
				including to known pornographers--
				and that's cool, that's cool-- but
				I'm saying, she needs money, and of
				course they're gonna say they didn't
				get it 'cause she wants more, man,
				she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
				hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
				Sir?
				Well, okay, you're not privy to all
				the new shit, so uh, you know, but
				that's what you pay me for.  Speaking
				of which, would it be possible for
				me to get my twenty grand in cash?
				I gotta check this with my accountant
				of course, but my concern is that,
				you know, it could bump me into a
				higher tax--
				Well, okay, if you've already made
				out the check.  Brandt is handing
				him a letter-sized envelope which is
				distended by something inside.
				Whose toe was it, Walter?
				The nail polish, Walter.
				Someone else's--where the fuck are
				they gonna--
				But Walter--
				They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
				then they're gonna kill me--
				What about the toe?
				Walter, this isn't a First Amendment
				thing.
				All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry
				ma'am.
				Far out.  Far fuckin' out.
				Hunh?
				Hey!  This is a private residence,
				man!
				Nice marmot.
				Jesus!
				Jesus Christ!
				Excuse me?
				My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!
				My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's
				that smell?
				When will you find these guys?  I
				mean, do you have any promising leads?
				I figure my only hope is that the
				big Lebowski kills me before the
				Germans can cut my dick off.
				Thanks Walter.
					(bitterly)
				Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me
				a very secure feeling.
				That makes me feel all warm inside.
				This whole fucking thing--I  could
				be sitting here with just pee-stains
				on my rug.
				They're nihilists.
				They kept saying they believe in
				nothing.
				Yeah.
				What're you, a fucking park ranger
				now?
				Who gives a shit about the fucking
				marmot!
				Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need
				your sympathy, man, I need my fucking
				Johnson!
				Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,
				Walter!
				Another Caucasian, Gary.
				Friends like these, huh Gary.
				Ahh, not so good, man.
					(absently)
				Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern
				thing?
				Mm.
				Well I like your style too, man.
				Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
				The fuck are you talking about?
				Yeah.  Thanks man.
				No it's fine, really, uh--
				I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta
				respecfully, 69 you know, tender my
				resignation on that matter, 'cause
				it looks like your mother really was
				kidnapped after all.
				Hey man, why don't you fucking listen
				occasionally?  You might learn
				something.  Now I got--
				Now I got--
				I'm telling you, I got definitive
				evidence--
				The main guy, Dieter--
				Well--yeah, I guess--
				Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,
				you know him?
				Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
				Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
				Well...yeah--
				Well yeah...I know that.
				Well, no, not exactly.  It's a
				complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.
				Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to
				keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands
				in old Duder's--
				Huh?  No, really, I don't even have
				the bruise any more, I--
				Delayed after-eff--
				Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
				Fuck Me.
				Fuckola, man.
				The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
				Who the fuck is that?
				Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
				Yeah.
				Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show
				Walter, so what?
				Uh-huh.
				Uh-huh.
				No.
				Uh.
				Fuck me, man!  That kid's already
				spent all the money!
				Look, man, did you--
				Just ask him if he--ask him about
				the car, man!
				Is the car out front yours?
				We know it's his fucking homework,
				Walter!  Where's the fucking money,
				you little brat?
				Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
				And the fucking money!
				No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
				I accept your apology. . . No I, I
				just want to handle it myself from
				now on. . . No.  That has nothing to
				do with it. . . .Yes, it made it
				home, I'm calling from home.  No,
				Walter, it didn't look like Larry
				was about to crack.
				Well that's your perception. . .
				Well you're right, Walter, and the
				unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
				LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,
				I'll be at practice.
				Huh?
				This is quite a pad you got here,
				man.  Completely unspoiled.
				White Russian, thanks.  How's the
				smut business, Jackie?
				Which one was Logjammin'?
				On you, maybe.
				Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off
				manually.
				I thought you might know, man.
				But she hasn't run off, she's been--
				Yeah, well, right man, there are
				many facets to this, uh, you know,
				many interested parties.  If I can
				find your money, man-- what's in it
				for the Dude?
				Does the Pope shit in the woods?
				Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way
				you do business.  Your money is being
				held by a kid named Larry Sellers.
				He lives in North Hollywood, on
				Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.
				A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
				your goons'll be able to get it off
				him, mean he's only fifteen and he's
				flunking social studies.  So if you'll
				just write me a check for my ten per
				cent. . . of half a million. . .
				fifty grand.
				I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you
				mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.
				No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's
				got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just
				wanted a car.  All the Dude ever
				wanted. . . was his rug back. . .
				not greedy. . . it really.
				He was innocent.  Not a charge was
				true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.
				I know my rights.
				I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I
				want Bill Kunstler.
				Uh-huh.
				That guy treats women like objects,
				man.
				I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
				--Ow!  Fucking fascist!
				Jesus, man, can you change the
				station?
				I've had a--
				--had a rough night, and I hate the
				fucking Eagles, man--
				Jesus.
				Maude?
				That's my robe.
				Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
				I was, uh, one of the authors of the
				Port Huron Statement.--The original
				Port Huron Statement.
				Not the compromised second draft.
				And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the
				Seattle Seven?
				And then. . . let's see, I uh--music
				business briefly.
				Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed
				of Sound Tour.
				Bunch of assholes.  And then, you
				know, little of this, little of that.
				My career's, uh, slowed down a bit
				lately.
				Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.
				Drive around.  The occasional acid
				flashback.
				Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.
				Wanted to save the finder's fee.
				He thought I had your father's money,
				so he got me out of the way while he
				looked for it.
				Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.
				Real fucking brat.
				It's a complicated case, Maude.
				Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately
				I've been adhering to a pretty strict,
				uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,
				you know, limber.  I'm real fucking
				close to your father's money, real
				fucking close.  It's just--
				Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
				But your father--he runs stuff, he--
				But he's--
				Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is
				that yoga?
				Increases?
				Well...no, of course not--
				Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
				Huh...
				So...that doctor.
				No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.
				A real reactionary. . . So your
				father. . . Oh man, I get it!
				Yeah, my thinking about the case,
				man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.
				Your father--
				Walter, if you're there, pick up the
				fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,
				this is an emergency.  I'm not--
				Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I
				need you to come pick me up--
				Huh?
				It is a fucking emergency.
				THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,
				just call Donny then, and ask him to--
				WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA
				GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR
				I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
				Get out of that fucking car, man!
				Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,
				man!
				Who the fuck are you?  Why've you
				been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
				Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
				Huh?
				I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay
				away from my fucking lady friend,
				man.
				She's not my special lady, she's my
				fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping
				her conceive, man!
				Who're you working for?  Lebowski?
				Jackie Treehorn?
				The?  Who the fff--
				Jesus fucking Christ.
				Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on
				the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.
				Yeah, it sucks.
				Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.
				And stay away from my special la--
				from my fucking lady friend.
				I mean we totally fucked it up, man.
				We fucked up his pay-off.  And got
				the kidnappers all pissed off, and
				the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,
				but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
				I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
				up, then why does he still leave me
				in charge of getting back his wife?
				Because he fucking doesn't want her
				back, man!  He's had enough!  He no
				longer digs her!  It's all a show!
				But then, why didn't he give a shit
				about his million bucks?  I mean, he
				knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,
				but he never asked for it back.
				His million bucks was never in it,
				man!  There was no money in that
				briefcase!  He was hoping they'd
				kill her!  You throw out a ringer
				for a ringer!
				Shit yeah!
				Huh?
				Walter, come off it.  You're not
				even fucking Jewish, you're--
				You're fucking Polish Catholic--
				Yeah, and you were--
				And you were divorced five fucking
				years ago.
				This driveway.
				It's just part of your whole sick
				Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her
				fucking dog.  Going to her fucking
				synagogue.  You're living in the
				fucking past.
				Where'd she been?
				But I guess she told Dieter.
				Where's the money, Lebowski?
				We know the briefcase was empty,
				man.  We know you kept the million
				bucks yourself.
				You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped
				and you could use it as a pretext to
				make some money disappear.  All you
				needed was a sap to pin it on, and
				you'd just met me.  You thought,
				hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone
				the square community won't give a
				shit about.
				Well. . . yeah.
				Walter!
				WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S
				CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
				He can't walk, Walter!
				Help me put him back in his chair.
				Walter, you fuck!
				We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
				There ya go.  Sorry man.
				Uh-huh.
				Yeah.
				They finally did it.  They killed my
				fucking car.
				You don't have the fucking girl,
				dipshits.  We know you never did.
				So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.
				Hey, cool it Walter.
				Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal,
				there never was any money.  The big
				Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,
				man, so take it up with him.
				Come on, Walter, we're ending this
				thing cheap.
				Come on, Walter!.
				Four dollars here!
				Almost five!
				Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
				They shot Donny!
				Then what's...
				Wha.
				Wha. . . Donny--
				Yeah man.
				Jeffrey Lebowski.
				The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
				Nothing.
				Well can we--
				Can we just rent it from you?
				Walter--
				Hey man, don't you have something
				else you could put it in?
				Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking
				asshole!
				You make everything a fucking
				travesty!
				What about that shit about Vietnam!
				What the fuck does Vietnam have to
				do with anything!  What the fuck
				were you talking about?!
				You're a fuck, Walter!
				Two oat sodas, Gary.
				Thanks, man.
				Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you
				eat the bear, and, uh.
				Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered
				if I'd see you again.
				Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,
				ups and downs.
				Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I
				gotta get back.
				Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude
				abides.
